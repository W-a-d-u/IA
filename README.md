First Python Program:

Takes either a PDF or Txt File as an input.
Removes puncuation, stopwords, checks if is English Word and lemmatizes the words.
Asks for number of words wanted in word cloud.
Creates a word cloud for the text of choice.

Things I Would Change:
Create more function to make it more modular.
Could have had the initial word cloud generated then ask if they would like any stop words removed and then generate a new word cloud. 
Also would've followed better idioms for python next time such as the naming of words next time.
